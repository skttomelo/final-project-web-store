               <h2>Welcome to Flooding Beverages,</h2>
                <p>Flooding beverages is a company based in Georgia. Our name comes from two different things. Our story and the
                     taste of our beverages. Our Company was founded by two graduating college roommates who, right after graduation,
                      home flooded. They had business degrees and nowhere to go until they saw an ad that a soda company was looking for
                       new owners to steer the ship back to the spotlight. So they rebranded the company made some new beverages and gave
                        the company a new purpose. 10% of each purchase that you make goes to helping victims of natural disasters. Also 
                        our Soda is so that people who drink our product report their house flooding in the numerous flavors we provide.</p>
