# final-project-web-store
For my final project in web programming I was tasked with making a responsive web store without external libraries like bootstrap with another person. The site utilized html, css, js, and php. The site had to include a database that handle users, orders, and stock
# What I learned
* PHP for the most part because I had never used it prior
* How to make a database with sql within PHP (Not like a god or anything if I'm being honest)
* How to handle sessions for users logging in, signing up, and ordering items
* How to handle changes like updates to a databases when a user ordered something that was in stock
* How to work around team members to balance strenghs and weaknesses
